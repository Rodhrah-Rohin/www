## Meaning behind the name and tagline

#### Rodhrah Rohin

Rodhrah Rohin is a combination of 2 sanskrit words
Rodhrah - A tree whose roots go deep into the earth, signifies humility and groundedness
Rohin - Growing or ascending, signifies a new begining and upward movement
Together, Rodhrah Rohin signifies an entity that is rooted in depth and rising in spirit.
Drawing from the imagery of a tree with deep foundations (Rodhrah) and the energy of upward ascension (Rohin), it represents the belief that the higher you wish to reach, the deeper you must be rooted.
This goes well given the company is intended to be a root/parent company, where each child is a branch that can grow strong, wide and high as the roots are deeply founded

#### Sthitah Pragati Pathi

Sthitah Pragati Pathi

Sthitah: Firmly established, steady, or rooted.

Pragati: Progress or advancement.

Pathi: On the path.

Together, it translates to "Steady on the path of progress."
